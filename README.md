# Best Stocks Finder :bar_chart:
## What is it üßê
This is a website application designed for finding "the best" deals :moneybag: in the stock market.

Users can select their preferred trading strategy (either buying :chart_with_upwards_trend: or selling :chart_with_downwards_trend:) and specify a time frame. 
The application then presents a table populated with various stocks and their current prices. 
The stocks displayed come from the technical summary section of the https://www.investing.com website and their information are extracted using web scraping :razor: techniques.

This application is made for fun :clown_face: so **don't look for a financial advice here!**
